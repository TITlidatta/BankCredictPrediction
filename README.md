# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This repository contains a project involving exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. The project focuses on understanding trends, distributions, and relationships in the dataset, particularly for a competition registration scenario.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize a dataset to uncover meaningful insights. It includes identifying missing values, creating statistical summaries, and producing visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.

### Key Highlights:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generated descriptive statistics to understand data distributions.

2. **Visualization Insights:**
   - **Histograms:**
   - **Boxplots:**
   - **Scatter Plots:**

## Features
1. Identification of missing values and data quality issues.
2. Visualizations to uncover trends and outliers.
3. Insights on customer behavior and campaign performance.

## Results
- Detailed analysis of customer demographics and behavior.
- Visual trends that highlight key aspects of the data.

## Acknowledgments
- The project was a part of IIT Madras machine learning project kaggle competition.
- Visualizations created using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
